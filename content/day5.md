Summary: Bye Tokyo, Hello Vietnam

### But not you!
Chat with Marcus, my Swedish roommate. I asked him about the Swedish air sip thing [1]. He said that generally Swedes try to avoid using unnecesary language, unlike many Americans, quickly qualifying he didn't include me in that generalization. Hmmmmmm

### Bye, France ;(
Said bye to my French friends. Jean-Charles, the physics teacher, said something along the lines of me having a good heart/soul. I felt the same about him. I genuinely hope to see him in France one day.

### Zojo-ji + Tokyo Tower
Walked to do this virtual reality amusement park with Marcus. We talked about languages and language learning on the walk over. Snapped some photos in front of the temple.

Once we arrived, we decided I didn't have enough time to do the VR justice because flight. Since it was at the Tokyo Tower, I went up there instead. I was on my phone and didn't notice until it was too late that the elevator was see through (starting a little after the bottom). It wasn't nearly as spectacular on the way down :(

### Google Tokyo
The receptionist was soooo nice. I must have looked lost because two employees started talking to me, and showed me to the cafe. I had lunch with them, though one, Janet, was worried that I was going to miss my plane. I trusted her judgement, scarfed down my food, and ran out.

### To the Airport
Swung by hostel to pick up my stuff, and jogged to the Asakusa station. Train ride was pleasant, and the airport line wasn't bad. Talked to an American in the check-in line. She was skeptical about her boyfriend's crypto schemes. I didn't hide my skepticism of crypto either.

### now i am become gringo, creator of blogs [2]
Snuck into an empty row on the flight (the exit row too, so had plenty of leg room). Played around with Pelican (static site generator written in Python), and started writing this blog. I'm still super far behind and writing things way out of order, writing **THIS** post on 2023-05-02 for example.

### Hello Hà Nội
Met two Americans, who are in the Army and Navy and stationed in Guam. My visa troubles continued - I was pulled to the special section where I was questioned whether this was my first time entering the country on this visa (since it was dated for entry a few days earlier - 2023-04-15. See post from 2023-04-14).

#### Taxi
Fell asleep in taxi listening to podcast on nuclear war. No wonder I'm so happy and optimistic.

#### Beer Street
Met my parents. Went to beer street, and met Trancy + Rafi (= Trafi). Had some beer at a very loud bar with live music. The cover singer had an amazing voice. Went to a quiet place for a bite to eat. My achilles was grazed by a moped wheel! Sheer luck; nobody has that sort of motor control.

1. From the Wikipedia article *Ingressive_sound* on 2023-05-02: `In Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, words like "ja", "jo" (yes), "nei/nej" (no) are often pronounced with inhaled breath. The main function of inhaled speech can be paralinguistic, showing agreement with a statement and encouraging a speaker to continue, but in northern Sweden, "Yes" can be replaced with an inhalation alone. It is consequently also typical of dialogue.`
