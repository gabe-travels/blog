Summary: lazy beach day with insufficient sunscreen

I was going to title this post Pink Irony, but it is May Day.

Went to the Sound of Silence. The espresso and ambiance were good, though the bathroom lacked soap.

Grabbed some beach chairs at Ladies May's (spelling correct). They made a phenomonal seafood rice. Did some body surfing. I tried to find volleyball - jogged down the beach about 800m and found a net, but nobody was playing.

Finished *The Tattooist of Auschwitz* (thanks for the rec, Annie), then passed out for a ~half hour nap which felt like 2 hours.

Dinner at Rustic House. Very good cocktails, food not shabby.

Taxi home. I included a single sock when I sent my clothes for laundering. The poor owner of the hotel said she ran around the entire hotel looking for it, supposing she lost it.

Made a dent in *The Brothers Karamazov*.
