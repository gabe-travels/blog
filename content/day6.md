Summary: A brief tour of Hanoi

### <3 Coffee
The coffee is super strong here. Like 2-3x as strong as the US.

We started by walking by Sword Lake, which was right by our hotel. Tried some nau nong (hot coffee w/ condensed milk). Stopped at the restaurant Bún Thang Thanh along the way. I scraped my arm on a piece of metal! Luckily I'm up to date (I think!?) on my tetanus shot.

### The Citadel
Went to the Citadel. There were many groups of small kids taking class photos. Some of them in a very cute/shy manner tried practicing their English with me, waving at me while snapping "hi".

### Building D67
The American War history was very interesting - refering to the US as American Imperialists and the American Empire. And the war not being the Vietnam War, but the American War. Chompsky-esque.

The bunker itself was fascinating.

### Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum
Met up with Trafi, and head to the Mausoleum. There were a group of tourists that insisted on taking pictures with us.

### Chùa Một Cột
Went to the Buddhist Temple afterwards. The illustrated Laws of Karma were quite entertaining.

### <3 Food
Best meal I've had in Vietnam (writing this post on 2023-05-02): Phở Cuốn Chinh Thắng.

Got some coffee afterwards, got a quick outdoor workout, and took a Grab to the Hotel. Grab is sooooooooo much better than Uber.

### Massage + Beer
Went to the Omamori Spa Old Quarter. The massage was really good, but my guy was really strong. I didn't want to back down after he asked if I want it stronger; I was in pain for quite some time.

Got some beer and appetizers. Recouped at the hotel. Later, walked around with mum, checked out a church, and went to The Corner Food : Bún Bò Nam Bộ - Phở Bò Sốt Vang. The owner was really sweet.
