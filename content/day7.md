Summary: Bus to Sapa

Finally up to date on the blog. Worked on my Vietnamese Anki flashcards, adding useful words like:

1. nau nong -> hot brown coffee
2. nau da -> iced brown coffee
3. den nong -> hot black coffee

In order to do this, I bought one of each coffee, took a picture, and added to my Anki deck.

The driver has been doing some crazy passes; I'm finding it kind of fun (would be ironic if these were my last published words; have wifi on bus).
