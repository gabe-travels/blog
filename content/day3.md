Summary: Uenu; Yoyogi; Meiji; Conveyor sushi!

### Early morning
Woke up at 5:30 am. Asakusa was so peaceful in the morning. Only a handful of people near the temple. Walked to "the esplanade" for a stroll and some pullups.

### Ameyoko District + Ueno Park
Met up with the parents and walked to the Ameyoko Shopping District. Bought some candied crab - atrocious. Sat down for some sashimi.

Walked through Ueno park. Sadly museums are closed on Monday. Hopped on subway to Yoyogi.

### Yoyogi + Meiji
**Gringos:**
There was a congregation of gringos, but I was too shy to figure out what it was about.

**Dog Park:**
My parents prematurely concluded that Japanese dogs are so well behaved that they don't bark. There was a dog that was uncannily similar to our dog, beak.

**Olympic Village:** The garden was tranquil - beautiful setting for an [olympic orgy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhKuqGyFqh8)

**Meiji:**
I loved the canopy of trees on the way to the temple. Temple somehow reminded me of the Jedi enclave on Dantooine in KOTOR.

### Conveyor Belt Sushi @ Ginza
Before the restaraunt, we went to a Taiwanese place for drinks. The Taiwanese bartender had perfect, beautiful English. He exchanged in South Dakota. He made a ginger infused gin for mum - very tasty.

Finally, went to the restaraunt recomended by Trafi. The concept was fun but the food was underwhelming compared to yesterday's sushi, especially the standing sushi.

### EOD
Hung out with the french at my hostel, again.
