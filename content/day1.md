Summary: Arrive in the evening; Friendly Deutsch; Parents have no self-preservation!

Landed 22 mins ahead of schedule, at 15:53. A JAL agent was waiting to see if I had the Vietnam visa, so he could help connect me. :(

Exchanged some money and bought a ticket to Asakusa.

I had some ramen and waited at a cafe (which also happened to be a hostel).

I decided to book a room there, rather than stay with my parents, since they are a little slow and got lost.

My parents have very little street sense - traffic and physics mean nothing to them. JETLAG IS NOT A VALID EXCUSE FOR WALKING INTO STREET.
