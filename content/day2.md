Summary: Asakusa Tour; Sushi

### Good Fortune
Explored Asakusa with the parents. I purchased a fortune scroll. A local helped me translate - good fortune (2nd best, in fact)! Something about my wife being behind me, and about how my actions have consequences (who knew) - my downfall would be my own making.

### Standing Sushi
Phenomonal standing sushi - [Magurobito Kaminarimon Branch](https://goo.gl/maps/MT1Ry7ZVAFG5ztSF8)

### City tour with Hiroshi
Western mythology influence from Alexander the Great. I noticed a lot of the gods/worship seem to relate to prosperity and business success. The giant lantern at Kaminarimon was donated by Panasonic (their original name, Matsushita)

Most (~90%) Japanese are both Buddhist and Shinto. How to differentiate temple: shinto temple has arch outside with 2 veritcal and 2 horizontal beams. The funniest sign I saw (not this day, but another): "This is a buddhist temple, no double clap here", as there's a double bow, double clap, pray, another bow ritual which one perfoms at Shinto temple.

Went to Matsuchiyama Syouden, where I ate shit after slipping on moss. There was a neat mini-monorail. My parents inexplicably bought a large turnip (we offered one at the temple for our family's prosperity).

I like the aesthetic of the old apartment buildings with exposed eletrical wires, somehow.

### More Sushi
We were going to go to the sushi restaurant rec'd by Trafi, but as a group of 3 Americans, were unable to board the train - too wide :(

Tried for 3 different trains too - they come every 5 mins :)

Instead, took the bus to a sushi place recommended by Gnana. They spoke exactly zero English, but all was possible with Google Translate :)

I stepped into the seating area with shoes to the emphatically expressed consternation of the staff. Food was good, but no fish belly as Gnana promised :(
