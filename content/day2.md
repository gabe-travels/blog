Summary: Asakusa Tour; Sushi

### Good Fortune
Explored Asakusa with the parents. I purchased a scroll which was supposed to tell my fortune. A local helped me translate- good fortune (2nd best, in fact!).

### Standing Sushi
Phenomonal standing sushi.

### City tour with Hiroshi
Western mythology influence from Alexander the Great. I noticed a lot of the gods/worship seem to relate to prosperity and business success.

Most (~90%) Japanese are both Buddhist and Shinto. How to differentiate temple: shinto temple has arch outside with 2 veritcal and 2 horizontal beams.

### More Sushi
We were going to go to the sushi restaurant rec'd by RT, but as a group of 3 Americans, were unable to board the train (too wide). Tried for 3 different trains too - they come every 5 mins :).

Instead, took the bus to a sushi place recommended by Nanabyte. They spoke exactly zero English, but all was possible with Google Translate :)

I stepped into the seating area with shoes to the emphatically expressed consternation of the staff. Food was good, but no fish belly as promised :(
