Summary: Justice on the Bus; Ninh Binh is basically 100% British; (Bus) Karoke?!

### Bus from Cat Ba to Ninh Binh
#### Waiting
Said bye to the brother. Got some coffee at the Republic Hostel while waiting for our bus. Saw the Dutch couple that reccomended the 50cc scooters again - we thought we were on the same bus, since it was supposed to arrive at the same time. Turns out they had a different one that left 5 mins before ours.

#### Ferry
6 identical stands. 6 babuskas waving me over to buy stuff. The babushka I bought from started coughing as soon as she finished cutting my coconut :(

On the ferry, saw our Argentinian friends from the boat yesterday. They gave me a Spanish lesson :)

The post-ferry bus driving was absolutely nuts. Still surprised I haven't seen a crash here.

#### Justice
This annoying couple was taking up 4 seats. I asked to sit next to the guy, with the pretense that my seat was less comfortable - it actually was, as it was the last row in the bus. He agreed and moved his bag. After a minute he decided to move next to his girlfriend.

### The Scorched Pink Flesh of the English [1]
Very lively hostel. Approximately 90% of the people there were British. Spent the day drinking, playing pool, learning German words [2], playing cards. Eventually went over with a group of British/Scandinavians to a Karoke bar. But the bar was a bus. And there were two buses! Eventually one bus won out, and the other was a ghosttown. My pop song lyrics knowledge is abysmal.

Headed back to the hostel around 1am. Another group that was heading to the "bar" tried to get me to come out again. Talked to some cool people from Israel, who were playing Codenames in Hebrew.

2. Learned the words Ausführung and Umsetzung, both meaning execution. In the context of playing pool: "meine Intuition ist gut, aber meine Ausführung ist immer noch scheiße." Which means "my intuition is good but my execution is still shit."
