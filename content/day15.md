Summary: Lazy Day in Ninh Binh; Night Train

### Quiet before the Storm
Very rainy morning. Went out with parents but decided to head back inside because the storm was too intense. Mum insisted on continuing walking. I started the day with an espresso, a Den Nong, and a smoothie bowl at the hostel. The lightning started up. I got worried about mum, who had no cell phone nor money, but she washed up an hour later impersonating a wet rat dog.

### Cafe + Shopping + Massage
Went to a cafe (An Tam Coc) and got some excellent vegetarian food. Met an Argentinian guy, who taught me the difference between un Scooter (no clutch), un motosilla, y una motocicleta (same as motosilla). And the verb for riding them (montar generally, but in some countries andar). His girlfriend was mad at him so they split off for the morning. He says he normally knows what he did, but was unsure this time.

Went shopping, trying to find some sliders, but they were all too small. Parents kept wanting to shop, but I wasn't having it so got a massage. It was truly phenomonal.

### Can't escape the French
Went back to the cafe from earlier, where I sat down and wrote yesterday's blog. Met a nice French couple. The husband works in tech (virtualization), and saw me writing using Emacs. So he started talking to me.

Went for dinner at the Family Restaraunt. The food was great and the staff nice. Though the duck was underwhelming. The captain was my age, and said to ditch the parents next time I come to Vietnam and bring my girlfriend. 

### Nor the Germans
As we kept walking, I saw my German friends who recomended I move to Hamburg. They were enjoying 10k VND ($0.43) beers.

I kept walking, as my parents said they saw a dog being cooked in that location earlier, and I had a morbid curiosity to see the stall. They said the dog was quickly hidden after some dirty looks from tourists.

### Escape from Ninh Binh
Swung by the hostel and said bye to some people I met. Met my parents at the hotel. There were some gopniks doing a photoshoot and making lots of noise. Taxi to train station.

### Wunderkind
As we were waiting for the train, this kid came up to me and asked if he could practice his English, which was already quite good. We talked for about 20 mins.

Boarded the sleeper train and quickly passed out.
