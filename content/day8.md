Title: Day 8
Date: 2023-04-22
Summary: Sapa && Cat Cat

### Sapa
Very lazy day. Met the world famous Mama Chao, who offered a trekking tour to me and my gringo parents.

Got myself a whole coconut and some Den Nong (hot black coffee). Sat in the balcony of a cafe and practiced my Spanish/Vietnamese.

Visited the market and witnessed my parents unsuccessfully bartering. It was funny seeing a small child (~4 years old) carrying an even smaller child (~4 months old) on its back. Saw several instances of this.

### Cat Cat
Very pretty, but felt contrived. Had some pho ga and beer while overlooking the valley. Rode my first motorbike taxi.

### Evening
Had dinner with our hosts, her sister, and her sister's friends. The sister worked in Moscow and speaks Russian, and one of her friends worked in Taipei.

We had many shots of moonshine apple vodka. Whenever they asked if I wanted more, my rejoinder was "why not?". It was supposed to aid with sleep. Apparently it did as I fell asleep at 20:30.
