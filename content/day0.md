Summary: Flight from BOS->NRT - trouble at airport :(

#### The Morning
Moved the remainder of my stuff into storage in Mudasir's basement. Got coffee/waffle with my relucant host for the past 2 weeks.

Stopped by the office, but didn't have time for breakfast. Completed a few chores with Baggy acting as sherpa, including returning my 2 month overdue library books.

Ride to airport with Weak Gym Partner. We roasted each other, a shallow facade for how we were really feeling.

### Disaster at Airport
At check-in counter, I was told I couldn't board because my visa was not approved. Visa on arrival is not an option for Vietnam!

**Solution:**

1. Pay $400 for an express visa and hope it comes in
2. Deplane in Tokyo

For the second option, I needed an exit ticket from Japan. At the check-in counter, I purchased a ticket in fewer than 5 mins.

### Le Flight
JAL was amazing. The bathroom sinks actually had sensors, and the windows were really cool (buttons you would use for dimming, which lagged a bit). I didn't stop eating the whole time. Internet was pretty bad, but I was able to do some work using (my company's interal) VS-Code. Listened to/read transcript of podcast on circadian rhythms/jetlag.

### Visa :(
Kept checking my Vietnam visa status, as I could still make connection if it was approved. My checking did not help.
