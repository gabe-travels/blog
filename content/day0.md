Summary: Flight from BOS->NRT - trouble at airport :(

Ride to airport with Gil. We both cried on the inside.

At check-in counter, I was told I couldn't board because my visa was not approved. Visa on arrival is not an option for Vietnam! Solution: 1) Pay $400 for an express visa and hope it comes in, or 2) Deplane in Tokyo. For the second option, I needed to prove I was exiting the country, so I booked the fastest ticket in my life (less than 5 mins, probably 2-3).

JAL was amazing. The bathroom sinks actually had sensors, and the windows were really cool (buttons you would use for dimming, which lagged a bit). I didn't stop eating the whole time. Internet was pretty bad, but I was able to do some work using (my company's interal) VS-Code.

Kept checking my Vietnam visa status, as I could still make connection if it was approved. My checking did not help.
