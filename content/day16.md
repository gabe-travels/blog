Summary: new city still lazy

### Train
The train was not nearly as clean as the previous one. We were loud and annoying in the morning, fulfilling our obligation as gringo tourists. Poor roommate. Eventually started talking to him after we woke him up. He is from Ecuador, but lives near Milano. He complimented my Spanish. Me encanta white lies :)

### Taxi Family
Our taxi from the hotel didn't show up. A guy at the train station sold us on his taxi. It turns out the driver is his uncle, and the man in the passenger seat his father! The father has been giving tours of Vietnam since 1995. He had these really cute detailed handwritten (some in English) journals, going back years.

### Hotel + Food + Pool
Pleased with the hotel, The Moon Homestay. The proprietor profusely apologize for the taxi not showing up. She and her husband are very kind.

Got some food at ROM Vegetarian Bistro with my family.

Spent some time reading by the pool, and talked with a girl from Portugal.

### Street Food
Went out later with the parents. Stopped by a Catholic church and saw a mass in progress. I received communion and immediately combusted.

I tried on some sandals, but didn't find a pair with which I was satisfied. My zapatillas grow stinkier by the day.

Sat by the river for some cocktail at Cầu Duyên cafe. Ordered ginger tea too, requesting minimal sugar. We must have missed the memo on it being opposite day. After, we went to The Son Bistro for a quick bite.

Crossed the river and got some street food. I was grazed by a gopnik on a bike. Home sleepy write blog.
