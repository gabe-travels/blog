<h2> Day 0 </h2>
<b> date: 2023-04-14 </b>

<b> category: Japan </b>
<h4>The Morning</h4>
<p>Moved the remainder of my stuff into storage in Mudasir's basement. Got coffee/waffle with Baguette#2, my relucant host for the past 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Stopped by the office, but didn't have time for breakfast. Completed a few chores with Baguette#1 acting as sherpa, including returning my 2 month overdue library books.</p>
<p>Ride to airport with Weak Gym Partner. We roasted each other, a shallow facade for how we were really feeling.</p>
<h3>Disaster at Airport</h3>
<p>At check-in counter, I was told I couldn't board because my visa was not approved. Visa on arrival is not an option for Vietnam!</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Pay $400 for an express visa and hope it comes in</li>
<li>Deplane in Tokyo</li>
</ol>
<p>For the second option, I needed an exit ticket from Japan. At the check-in counter, I purchased a ticket in fewer than 5 mins.</p>
<h3>Le Flight</h3>
<p>JAL was amazing. The bathroom sinks actually had sensors, and the windows were really cool (buttons you would use for dimming, which lagged a bit). I didn't stop eating the whole time. Internet was pretty bad, but I was able to do some work using (my company's interal) VS-Code. Listened to/read transcript of podcast on circadian rhythms/jetlag.</p>
<h3>Visa :(</h3>
<p>Kept checking my Vietnam visa status, as I could still make connection if it was approved. My checking did not help.</p>
