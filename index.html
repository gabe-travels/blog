    Ride to airport with Gil. They won't let me board, because not approved! Solution: deplane in Tokyo. Need to buy an exit ticket, so I book a ticket to Hanoi for the following week.

    JAL was amazing. The bathroom sinks actually had sensors, and the windows were really cool (buttons you would use for dimming. I didn't stop eating the whole time.
